1. Build Shopify integration
- has to access their database of products and designs
- has to be able to display a customizable render (either 2d or 3d)
- must have real-time price calculations
2. Build customizable framework
- users can customize clothing based off silhouette, frabric, and color.
- Note not all frabric's would have a color so there will have to be a flag
- Price would have to be updated real-time as user is making changes
3. Allow the user to "try on" clothing
4. Communicate price, customized options, and image back to Shopify
